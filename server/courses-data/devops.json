      "title": "What is DevOps?",
      "content": "DevOps is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aims to unify software development (Dev) and software operation (Ops). The primary goal of DevOps is to shorten the system development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives. DevOps emphasizes collaboration between developers and IT operations, automation of processes, and continuous monitoring throughout the software development lifecycle."

    {
      "title": "DevOps Principles",
      "content": "- Collaboration & Communication: Breaks down silos between development and operations teams.\n- Automation: Automates repetitive tasks such as testing, integration, and deployment.\n- Continuous Improvement: Encourages ongoing learning, feedback, and process refinement.\n- Infrastructure as Code: Manages infrastructure with code and automation tools.\n- Monitoring & Feedback: Uses metrics and log data to improve processes and products."
    },
    {
      "title": "DevOps Practices & Tools",
      "content": "- Continuous Integration (CI): Integrate code into a shared repository frequently using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.\n- Continuous Delivery (CD): Automate the deployment process to deliver changes quickly and reliably.\n- Configuration Management: Tools such as Ansible, Chef, or Puppet automate system configurations.\n- Containerization: Docker and Kubernetes provide consistent environments for development, testing, and production.\n- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack help monitor systems and applications."

      "title": "SDLC Methodologies Overview",
      "content": "The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by software industry to design, develop, and test high quality software. Common SDLC methodologies include:\n- Waterfall: Sequential development process with distinct phases.\n- Agile: Iterative development with collaboration and flexibility.\n- DevOps: Integrates development and operations for continuous delivery.\n- Lean: Focuses on minimizing waste and maximizing value.\n- Spiral: Combines iterative development with systematic aspects of waterfall."
    },
    {
      "title": "Waterfall Model",
      "content": "The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential SDLC approach. Each phase must be completed before the next phase begins, with little overlap. Phases include Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Waterfall is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements."
    },
    {
      "title": "Agile Methodology",
      "content": "Agile is an iterative and incremental SDLC approach. It emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and rapid delivery of small working increments. Agile includes frameworks like Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP). Agile teams work in short iterations (sprints) and adapt to changing requirements."
